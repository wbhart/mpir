; There is no initial pointer alignment lead in code below. The argument
; why not is based on some statistical reasoning and measurement points.
; All statements below strictly refer to the Intel i6xxx (Skylake) 
; microarchitecture.

; The function is intended to be used with arbitrary pointer alignment on
; entry. That is there are 8 possible cases to consider:

; - A: 1 x all pointers mis-aligned (mod 32 byte)
; - B: 3 x one pointer aligned (mod 32 byte))
; - C: 3 x two pointers aligned (mod 32 byte)
; - D: 1 x all pointers aligned (mod 32 byte)

; All sub cases under B show equivalent performance, as do all sub cases of
; C. B is 7% faster than A, C is 11% faster than A and D is 39% faster than A.

; To do a proper alignment would require a complex decision tree to allways 
; advance the alignment situation in the best possible manner - e.g. pointer
; 1 is off by 8 while pointer 2 & 3 are off by 16. To do the alignment
; requires some arith and at least one branch in the function proloque - a
; reasonable impact for small sized operands. And all this for a small gain
; (around 6% all summed up) in the average case.

; In a specific application scenario this might be the wrong choice.

; The execution speed of VMOVDQU is equivalent to VMOVDQA in case of aligned
; pointers. This may be different for earlier generations of Intel core 
; architectures like Broadwell, Haswell, ...

; cycles per limb with all operands aligned and in:

;                   LD1$      LD2$
;   Haswell         ???       ???
;   Broadwell       ???       ???
